		<h3 class="RI_title">Fishnet Model for the Strength Distribution of Nacreous Staggered Structures</h3>
		<p style="font-family:'Helvetica', 'Arial', 'Sans-Serif';">

			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nacre" target="_blank">Nacre</a>, also known as "mother-of-pearl", are widely found in nature. 
			Its typical "brick-and-mortar" microstructure has inspired lots of robust man-made hierarchical materials. They can achieve high defect insensitivity and fracture toughness. 
			This project studies the <b><font color=#5500ff>statistical strength distribution</font></b> of the material. Strictly for statistical purposes, 
			the microstructure of nacre is approximated by a diagonally pulled <b><font color=#5500ff>fishnet</font></b> with quasibrittle links representing the shear bonds between parallel 
			lamellae (or platelets).
		</p>
		
		<p style="font-family:'Helvetica', 'Arial', 'Sans-Serif';">The key idea of the analytical solution is to express the total structural survival probability as a series of survival probabilities corresponding to the disjoint
		failure events of exactly one link, two links, three links, etc. at the peak load.</p>
		<img src="../images/series_expansion.png" alt="nacre" width="320" hspace="90">
		<p style="font-family:'Helvetica', 'Arial', 'Sans-Serif';">These added survival probabilities are shown to greatly enhance the strength 
		for the lower tail of the strength distribution (i.e. failure proability), compared to the weakest-link model. The analytical predictions of failure probability are verified by 
		millions of Monte-Carlo simulations. There existed two basic, analytically tractable, statistical models for the strength of materials and structures: weakest-link model and 
		fiber bundle model. The fishnet model is shown to be another analytically tractable model that bridges the above two.</p>

		<h3 class="RI_title">Fishnet Model with Order Statistics</h3>
		<p style="font-family:'Helvetica', 'Arial', 'Sans-Serif';">
		For <b><font color=#5500ff>brittle</font></b> materials like dry nacre, a few terms in the series expansion suffice to guarantee convergence. In this sense, the fishnet model series expansion can be seen 
		as a perturbation from the weakest-link model. However, it is relatively hard to apply for <b><font color=#5500ff>quasibrittle</font></b> materials whose links exhibits progressive postpeak softening of various steepness. 
		More widely scattered damages occur before the peak load. This requires more higher-order terms to be considered. 
		It is, however, very tedious to calculate them and their expressions vary for different geometry and loading conditions. To tackle this problem, the strength distribution of the softening 
		fishnet is approximated by the order statistics of link strengths:
		</p>
		<img src="../images/order_statistics.png" alt="nacre" width="200" hspace="300">
		<p style="font-family:'Helvetica', 'Arial', 'Sans-Serif';">
		That is to say, it is no longer the weakest link but <b><font color=#5500ff> the <em>k</em>-th weakest link </font></b> that determines the peak load of the whole structure. The order <em>k</em> reflects the extent of 
		damages right before the maximum load, with it being in itself a discrete random variable. By adjusting the postpeak softening slope (brittleness) of the material, its failure probaility
		changes significantly, generating huge safety gains at the extreme lower tail of the strength distribution.</p>
